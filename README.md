# MCU-Cross-Word

## Test your knowledge of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in One Minute!

## Post Reflection:

#### Instructions:

There is only one player. As soon as the player starts the timer, they should give themselves 60 seconds to really know how much they know about the MCU. 

Once they finish, they can click the "Reset" button and try to beat their time!
