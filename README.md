# MCU-Cross-Word

## Test your knowledge of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in One Minute!

#### Instructions:

There is only one player. As soon as the player starts the timer, they have 60 seconds to really know how much they know about the MCU. 

Once they finish, they need to click the "Done!" button. If they choose to, they can click the "Reset" button and try to beat their time!

## Tech Stack
- DOM Manipulation
- Shuffling old words out for new ones.

### Stretch Goals:
- Completing the crossword and adding "beginner, intermediate, and expert" levels
- Adding different timers?
- Creating enough words/hints that can shuffle correctly

## Potential Roadblocks:
- Not adding enough detail to your code
- Timer/button(s) won't work
